# For physics topics, use the specific subtopics, e.g. "Astrophysics"
topic: "Computer Science"
# An empty list here will include all categories in a topic
# Use the natural language names of the topics, found here: https://arxiv.org
# Including more categories will result in more calls to the large language model
categories: ["Artificial Intelligence", "Computation and Language", "Machine Learning", "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"]

# Relevance score threshold. abstracts that receive a score less than this from the large language model
# will have their papers filtered out.
#
# Must be within 1-10
threshold: 7

# A natural language statement that the large language model will use to judge which papers are relevant 
#
# For example:
#     "I am interested in complexity theory papers that establish upper bounds"
#     "gas chromatography, mass spectrometry"
#     "making lots of money"
#
# This can be empty, which just return a full list of papers with no judgement or filtering,
# in whatever order arXiv responds with.

  1. Large language model pretraining, finetuning, and prompting techniques
  2. Multimodal machine learning (vision-language models, audio-language models, etc.)
  3. Novel neural network architectures and training methods
  4. Practical applications and real-world deployments of AI/ML systems
  5. Not interested in papers focused on specific languages (e.g., Arabic, Chinese-specific NLP)
  6. Not interested in narrow application papers (e.g., medical diagnosis for specific diseases)
