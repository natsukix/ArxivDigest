# # For physics topics, use the specific subtopics, e.g. "Astrophysics"
# topic: "Computer Science"
# # An empty list here will include all categories in a topic
# # Use the natural language names of the topics, found here: https://arxiv.org
# # Including more categories will result in more calls to the large language model
# categories: ["Artificial Intelligence", "Computation and Language"]

# # Relevance score threshold. abstracts that receive a score less than this from the large language model
# # will have their papers filtered out.

# # Must be within 1-10
# threshold: 7

# # A natural language statement that the large language model will use to judge which papers are relevant 
# #
# # For example:
# #     "I am interested in complexity theory papers that establish upper bounds"
# #     "gas chromatography, mass spectrometry"
# #     "making lots of money"
# #
# # This can be empty, which just return a full list of papers with no judgement or filtering,
# # in whatever order arXiv responds with.
# interest: |
#   1. Large language model pretraining and finetunings
#   2. Multimodal machine learning
#   3. Do not care about specific application, for example, information extraction, summarization, etc.
#   4. Not interested in paper focus on specific languages, e.g., Arabic, Chinese, etc.
