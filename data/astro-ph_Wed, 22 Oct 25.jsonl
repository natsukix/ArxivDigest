General relativistic radiative transfer is employed to compute synchrotron emission from thermal electrons and generate horizon-scale images. For the RIAF model, we analyze the dependence of image morphology on the deformation parameter, observing frequency, and flow dynamics. The photon ring and central dark region expand with increasing deformation parameter, with brightness asymmetries arising at high inclinations and depending on flow dynamics and emission anisotropy. The BAAF disk produces narrower rings and darker centers, while polarization patterns trace the brightness distribution and vary with viewing angle and deformation, revealing spacetime structure. These results demonstrate that intensity and polarization in thick-disk models provide probes of KZ black holes and near-horizon accretion physics."}

Searching for artifacts in the solar system has received relatively little formal scientific interest and has faced significant technical and social challenges. Automated surveys and new observational techniques developed over the past decade now enable astronomers to survey parts of the sky for anomalous objects. We briefly describe four methods for detecting extraterrestrial artifacts and probes within the Solar System and then focus on demonstrating one of these. The first makes use of pre-Sputnik images to search for flashes from glinting objects. The second method makes use of space-borne telescopes to search for artificial objects. A third approach involves examining the reflectance spectra of objects in Earth orbit, in search of the characteristic reddening that may imply long-term exposure of metallic surfaces to space weathering. We focus here on a fourth approach, which involves using Earth's shadow as a filter when searching for optically luminous objects in near-Earth space. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept of this method by conducting two searches for transients in images acquired by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which has generated many repeated 30-second exposures of the same fields. In this way, we identified previously uncatalogued events at short angular separations from the center of the shadow, motivating more extensive searches using this technique. We conclude that the Earth's shadow presents a new and exciting search domain for near-Earth SETI."}

We advocate that HWO must have the capability to track non-sidereal targets like the giant planets and their satellites; should be able to view auroras and atmospheres without saturation (e.g., through the use of filters or fast read-out modes); and with a high dynamic range to explore faint objects near bright discs.

These objects exhibit unusual spectral features reminiscent of stellar spectra with blackbody-like SEDs, large hydrogen Balmer breaks, Balmer line absorption, and classical stellar absorption features such as calcium H&K and the calcium triplet. Following the recent suggestion that these may be actively accreting direct-collapse black holes in the process of assembly, i.e. quasi-stars, we present evolutionary models of quasi-stars using our recently released, publicly available MESA-QUEST modeling framework. We compute a grid of models spanning a range of black hole masses and predict the luminosities, temperatures, surface gravities, and lifetimes of these objects. We find that these models lie along a Hayashi track once they hit their ``late-stage'' which constitutes the majority of their lives ($\\sim 20$~Myr). We present scaling relations for estimating the mass of a quasi-star as a function of the bolometric luminosity, as well as the bolometric luminosity as a function of the effective temperature for the Hayashi track. The short lifetimes in tandem with the observed number density of LRDs imply the possibility that every supermassive black hole was once a quasi-star. We compare synthetic spectra of our quasi-star models to observations of LRDs, and show that these models are broadly capable of reproducing the continuum spectra of observed LRDs. These results indicate that quasi-stars are promising candidates for the origin of supermassive black holes via direct collapse in the early universe."}

In close binary star systems, however, the companion star's gravity shrinks the region where orbits are long-term stable \\citep[]{Holman1999}, effectively excluding the zone where giants should form. Nevertheless, here we show that such systems exist and are not rare. Among 393 binary systems with measured orbits and circumstellar gas giants, we identify 19 for which the snowline region is unstable. The distribution of their metallicities and eccentricities is consistent with the background population, making a capture origin or enhanced solids abundance unlikely causes for their formation. Instead, we show that the sub-snowline formation paradox can be resolved by the tidal torque from the companion, which truncates the protoplanetary disk and creates a pressure bump and effective dust trap that facilitates the formation of gas giants. Using this model, we can successfully predict the observed locations of gas giants from their host binary properties. Moreover, the main inconsistent outliers from these predictions are found to be evolved stellar systems (white dwarfs or red-giant stars), further supporting the model and pointing to these being second-generation planets. Our results have therefore key implications for understanding planet formation processes and provide observational support for sub-snowline gas-giant formation and the role of trap-dusts in their formation."}

This work investigates how the lensing signature and detectability of dark matter subhalos in mock HST-, Euclid-, and JWST-like strong lensing observations depends on the subhalo's radial density profile, especially with regards to the inner power-law slope, $\\beta$. We demonstrate that the minimum-mass subhalo detectable along the Einstein ring of a system is strongly dependent on $\\beta$. In particular, we show that subhalos with $\\beta \\sim 2.2$ can be detected down to masses over an order-of-magnitude lower than their Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) counterparts with $\\beta \\sim 1$. Importantly, we find that the detectability of subhalos with steep inner profiles is minimally affected by increasing the complexity of the main lens galaxy's mass model. This is a unique characteristic of these subhalos, as those with NFW or shallower profiles become essentially undetectable when multipole perturbations are added to the lens model. The results of this work highlight how the underlying dark matter physics can significantly impact the expected number of subhalo detections from strong gravitational lensing observations. This is important for testing Cold Dark Matter against alternatives, such as Self-Interacting Dark Matter, which predict the existence of subhalos with diverse inner density profiles."}

Obtaining large, statistical samples of contact binaries from photometric surveys can put valuable constraints on the various processes involved in their evolution. Modeling those systems however present some challenges. In some contact-binary light curves, the O'Connell effect is visible, where the maxima at both quarter phases are unequal. In the literature, this effect is typically attributed to magnetic spots on the surface of the binary. In this work, we model contact-binary surfaces using PHOEBE, and include a parametric prescription for a lateral mass- and energy-transfer stream that travels from the hotter primary to the cooler secondary. We allow this stream to have a variable heat capacity. We fit a system from the Kepler sample with a strong O'Connell effect, and show that a low-heat capacity stream can explain the unequal maxima. This suggests that, in such systems, surface flows can play a significant role in transferring heat between components. Our methods can be used on larger samples of contact binaries from OGLE, Kepler, or TESS to advance our understanding of contact binary structure and evolution."}

Despite the offset, the association between the two sources is likely. We aim to study the diffuse X-ray emission around PSR J1740+1000 and its tail to investigate the origin of 1LHAASO J1740+0948u through a multi-wavelength SED fitting, testing different scenarios. We analysed ~500 ks of XMM-Newton observations and studied for the first time the diffuse emission around the pulsar. We also analysed the tail and how its emission evolves as a function of distance. We then performed a fit of the SED, including the spectrum of 1LHAASO J1740+0948u and the X-ray data obtained from either the analysis of the tail or the diffuse emission, to understand whether one of the two X-ray sources could be related to the TeV emission and attempt a source classification. The diffuse X-ray emission analysis resulted in upper limits in the 0.5-10 keV range. The tail is best fitted with a power law with $\\Gamma=1.76\\pm0.06$ in 0.5-8 keV, with no significant detection of spectral variations with distance. We do not find a good SED fit that can explain both the X-ray tail and the LHAASO spectrum with reasonable parameters, suggesting that the TeV emission likely comes from an older X-ray-faint electron population. We then performed an SED fitting of the VHE spectrum combined with the upper limits on the diffuse emission, constraining the magnetic field to be as low as $B\\leq1.2 \\mu$G.

While several modern cosmological simulations use the gas fraction-halo mass relation to calibrate their feedback implementations, we note that this relation exhibits substantial intrinsic scatter whose origin has not been fully elucidated. Using the large-volume FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulations, we examine the role of both central and satellite supermassive black holes (BHs) in shaping this scatter, probing higher halo masses than previously possible. For haloes with M500 < 10^13 Msun, we find that central BH mass correlates strongly and negatively with gas fraction, such that higher BH masses give rise to lower gas fractions at fixed halo mass, consistent with previous studies. Interestingly, however, for 10^13 Msun < M500 < 10^14.5 Msun the correlation reverses and becomes positive, with overmassive BHs residing in haloes with above-average gas fractions. By tracing progenitor BHs and haloes through cosmic time, we show that this behaviour is driven by the expulsion and subsequent re-accretion of halo gas, regulated by the timing of BH growth and feedback. Specifically, haloes that collapse earlier form BHs earlier, leading to earlier gas expulsion and re-accretion and a high gas fraction compared to haloes of the same present-day mass that formed later. Our results demonstrate that present-day scatter in the gas fraction-halo mass relation is strongly shaped by the early growth history of BHs and their haloes, a prediction that can be tested with future observational measurements."}

These objects can be used to infer the composition of exoplanetary material and identify evidence for key geological processes. However, the white dwarf atmospheric physics distorts the inferred material composition away from the true composition, mainly through differential atomic diffusion of the accreted metals. Correcting for this effect is essential, but is dependent on various physical assumptions associated with the white dwarf itself. We first focus on the effect of assumptions related to convective overshoot and thermohaline mixing on the atomic diffusion timescales. For white dwarfs with H-dominated atmospheres between 12000 K and 18000 K, we find that including a complete treatment of convective overshoot decreases the inferred Fe and O abundances in accreted material. For these white dwarfs, we also find that including thermohaline mixing decreases Fe and O abundances. For He-dominated systems, the effect of convective overshoot is comparatively minor. We then explore the overall effect of other physical assumptions by comparing publicly available grids of diffusion timescales. We find that the choice of model grid can have a large impact for white dwarfs with He-dominated atmospheres, notably on the inferred core to mantle ratio of accreted material. We identify several systems for which the geological interpretation is robust against these systematics. We also present a `discrepancy metric' which can be used to estimate the potential impact of changing the stellar physics without requiring detailed modelling."}

The two dominant interpretations favor hot exozodiacal dust or a faint companion, as both can produce similar signatures. Method: We modeled a system consisting of a star and a faint companion within a field of view of 2au x 2au. We calculated the visibility and closure phases for three VLTI instruments (PIONIER, GRAVITY, and MATISSE) and four telescope configurations. Aim: We aim to investigate the interferometric signatures of faint companions and assess their detectability. We explore limitations of current detection methods and evaluate the challenges in distinguishing between hot exozodiacal dust and a faint companion as the source of the observed excess. Results: We derived an upper limit for the companion-induced visibility deficit and closure phase. Contrary to the common interpretation that near-zero closure phases rule out the presence of a companion, we show that companions can remain undetected in closure phase data, as indicated by significant non-detection probabilities, yet, these companions can still produce measurable visibility deficits. We confirmed our results by reevaluating an L-band observation of kappa Tuc A. We found indications for a faint companion with a flux ratio of 0.7% and an estimated non-detection probability of around 21%, which could explain the variability of the previously observed visibility deficit. Conclusions: Previous companion rejection criteria, such as near-zero closure phases and flux estimates based on Gaussian-distributed dust densities, are not universally valid. This highlights the need for a reevaluation of companion rejections in former studies of the hot exozodiacal dust phenomenon. In addition, we propose a method for distinguishing both sources of visibility deficit."}

The observations were reduced using a combination of public and customized pipelines producing a total of 12 different versions of the transmission spectrum by varying: spectral binning, limb-darkening, and a novel correction for the occulted stellar spot. We then performed atmospheric retrievals using TauREx 3, comparing models of varying complexity, robustly detecting CH$_4$ (3-4$\\sigma$) across all configurations. The evidence for CO$_2$ is weaker and highly model-dependent. The tentative detection of dimethyl sulphide (DMS) vanishes in our most comprehensive retrieval models. We find that correcting the stellar spot in the NIRISS transit is a critical step, introducing a uniform offset that primarily drives the inference of a lower mean molecular weight atmosphere. Furthermore, the assumed complexity of the retrieval model itself introduces significant biases; including more molecules systematically increases the retrieved CH$_4$ abundance and atmospheric mean molecular weight, even for species without spectral features. The data are consistent with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere with an elevated O and an even more elevated C abundance, leading to a super-solar C/O.

In this work we present a new nuclear sensitivity study to explore the impact on the s process in massive stars of 86 neutron-capture rates, including all the reactions between C and Si and between Fe and Zr. We derive the impact of the rates at the end of the He-burning core and at the end of the C-burning shell, where the $^{22}$Ne($\\alpha$,n)$^{25}$Mg reaction is is the main neutron source. We confirm the relevance of the light isotopes capturing neutrons in competition with the Fe seeds as a crucial feature of the s process in massive stars. For heavy isotopes we study the propagation of the neutron-capture uncertainties, finding a clear difference of the impact of Fe and Co isotope rates with respect to the rates of heavier stable isotopes. The local uncertainty propagation due to the neutron-capture rates at the s-process branching points is also considered, discussing the example of $^{85}$Kr. The complete results of our study for all the 86 neutron-capture rates are available online. Finally, we present the impact on the weak s process of the neutron-capture rates included in the new ASTRAL library (v0.2)."}

The NSFRB search operates in real-time, utilizing a custom GPU-accelerated search code, \\texttt{cerberus}, implemented in Python with JAX. We summarize successful commissioning sensitivity tests with continuum sources and pulsar B0329+54, estimating the $6\\sigma$ flux (fluence) threshold to be ~290 mJy (~40 Jy ms). Future tests of recovery of longer timescale transients, e.g. CHIME J1634+44, are planned to supplement injection testing and B0329+54 observations.

By imposing the ~290 mJy flux limit on two representative models (the magnetar plastic flow model and the White Dwarf-M Dwarf binary model), we reject with 95% confidence the presence of White Dwarf-M Dwarf binary LPRTs with periods between ~10-70s within ~95% of the surveyed region. Combined with the prevalence of LPRTs in the Galactic Plane, our results motivate further consideration of both White Dwarf-M Dwarf binary models and isolated magnetar models. We will continue to explore novel LPRT search strategies during real-time operations, such as triggered periodicity searches and additional targeted surveys."}

On the $M_{\\rm H_2}$-overdensity-significance plane, HELMS-55 may follow the positive correlation between the gas mass and the overdensity significance, while SDP.17b lies well above the relation despite its large gas reservoir, making it a potential outlier. Based on this study of two DSFGs, our photometric analysis suggests that DSFGs can trace the outskirts of protoclusters or associated large-scale structures. However, our small sample prevents firm conclusions about their ability to pinpoint dense cluster cores. Future multi-object spectroscopic observations are required to confirm the membership and star formation properties of the companion galaxies."}

The flare loops and plasma cloud exhibit independent temperature profiles as a function of time, implying different heating mechanisms are present in these structures. We interpret the plasma cloud as an eruptive filament directly heated in the corona via magnetic reconnection that occurs when a rising filament interacts with this eruptive filament. Previous disk-integrated solar soft X-ray spectral measurements of this flare using the Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer CubeSat-1 (MinXSS-1) inferred coronal abundances at the flare peak. However, MinXSS synthetic spectra from AIA observations show that the plasma cloud is too tenuous to be detected in MinXSS-1 and thus the coronal abundances of low FIP elements must be in emission from the flare loops. Furthermore, we demonstrate the non-negligible differences in differential emission measures (DEMs) between coronal and photospheric abundance models.

Subsequent observations with the Keck and Gemini South observatories showed a reduction in the anti-tail and the growth of a conventional tail in a direction away from the sun. In this study we explain the physics behind this evolution. As a function of heliocentric distance, we model the apparent visual brightness of scattering in the ice coma. As the comet approaches the Sun, the exponential temperature dependence of the sublimation rate causes a continuous increase in the production rate of ice grains and a sharp decline in their residence time within the observing aperture. The combined effects produce a peak in total scattering cross-section due to H$_2$O ice grains at 3-4 AU.

Volnova", "subjects": "High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)", "abstract": "Density inhomogeneities are ubiquitous in space and astrophysical plasmas, particularly at magnetic reconnection sites, shock fronts, and within compressible turbulence. The gradients associated with these inhomogeneous plasma regions serve as free energy sources that can drive plasma instabilities, including the lower-hybrid drift instability (LHDI). Notably, lower-hybrid waves are frequently observed in magnetized space plasma environments, such as Earth's magnetotail and magnetopause. Previous studies have primarily focused on modeling particle acceleration via LHDI in these regions using a quasilinear approach. This study expands the investigation of LHDI to a broader range of environments, spanning weakly to strongly magnetized media, including interplanetary, interstellar, intergalactic, and intracluster plasmas. To explore the applicability of LHDI in various astrophysical settings, we employ two key parameters: (1) plasma magnetization, characterized by the plasma beta parameter, and (2) the spectral slope of suprathermal electrons following a power-law distribution. Using a quasilinear model, we determine the critical values of plasma beta and spectral slope that enable efficient electron acceleration via LHDI by comparing the rate of growth of instability and the damping rate of the resulting fluctuations. We further analyze the time evolution of the electron distribution function to confirm these critical conditions. Our results indicate that electron acceleration is generally most efficient in low-beta plasmas ($\\beta < 1$). However, the presence of suprathermal electrons significantly enhances electron acceleration via LHDI, even in high-beta plasmas ($\\beta > 1$). Finally, we discuss the astrophysical implications of our findings, highlighting the role of LHDI in electron acceleration across diverse plasma environments."}

Here, by examining the intensity variations of the spectral features that represent characteristic emissions from common artificial light sources, we show that the skyglow is predominantly shaped by artificial emissions, including compact fluorescent lamps and high-pressure sodium lamps. Contributions from commercially controlled lighting, including those for floodlighting and advertising adopting light-emitting diode and metal halide technologies, were more pronounced in urban areas during the hours leading up to midnight. We also documented direct evidence of the impact of a neon sign located on top of a commercial tower, illustrating how a single light source can significantly influence the surrounding environment. Compared with observations made a decade ago at the same location, our findings indicate a growing popularity of light-emitting diode lighting for external use, consistent with the existing literature. This first comprehensive spectroscopic investigation of light pollution in an urban environment emphasizes the evolving patterns of outdoor lighting and highlights the critical and unique role of spectroscopic measurements. The results provide essential information for the development of effective strategies and policies to mitigate light pollution in urban areas and at sites of astronomical importance."}

Here we propose a physical model which includes radiation locations sequentially triggered by propagating magnetic perturbations. It naturally explains all observed properties of these GRBs, including the self-similar FRED profile, multi-band aligned subpulses, hard-to-soft spectral evolution, local intensity tracking, and increasing subpulse durations.

We present a revision to this model (called ZodiSURF) that incorporates analytical forms of both the scattering phase function and albedo as a function of wavelength, which are empirically determined across optical wavelengths (0.3-1.6 micron) from over 5,000 HST sky surface brightness (sky-SB) measurements. This refined model results in significantly improved predictions of zodiacal light emission at these wavelengths and for Sun angles greater than 80 deg.

Remarkably, the HST sky-SB measurements show an excess of residual diffuse light (HST Sky - ZodiSURF - Diffuse Galactic Light) of 0.013 +/- 0.006 MJy/sr.

We present a novel subgrid jet-launching method for galaxy formation simulations and implement it in three hydrodynamical codes: the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code SWIFT, the moving-mesh code AREPO, and the Eulerian grid code PLUTO. To isolate the impact of hydrodynamical solvers on jet evolution, we compare idealised jets and their remnants in uniform and stratified media across resolutions and jet parameters. In uniform media, all jets drive bow shocks, inflate hot lobes, exhibit backflows, and evolve self-similarly. For the parameters explored, SWIFT lobes are shorter, wider, and hotter; AREPO lobes are longer, thinner, and cooler; while PLUTO lobes display complex flows with intermediate characteristics. In stratified media, jets deviate from self-similar evolution, inflating longer and thinner lobes due to lower external ram pressure. After switch-off, SWIFT jets evolve into smooth cylindrical bubbles, AREPO jets produce long filamentary remnants, and PLUTO jets yield intermediate-length remnants with varying degrees of mixing. Despite such differences, all jets and remnants have a similar impact on the ambient medium. We conclude that variations in lobe properties between codes emerge even for identical subgrid prescriptions, since the coupling of jet feedback to resolvable scales and the effective resolution depend on the hydrodynamical method. In structure formation simulations, these solver differences are likely subdominant to uncertainties in subgrid modelling and calibration, while averaging over galaxy populations may lessen their impact."}

This eruption perturbed the magnetic field of a second filament situated near its eastern footpoint, the second filament then erupted sympathetically about one hour later. The eruption of the second filament is a failed one, with the majority of the filament material falling back after the initial lifting. Although no GOES flare accompanied these filament eruptions, distinct brightenings were observed following each eruption. The second eruption produced a large coronal jet, which propagated along a bent trajectory with an apparent deflection angle of approximately 90 degrees. No clear evidence of magnetic reconnection was detected at the deflection site, thus we suspect that the jet may have traveled along an S-shaped trans-equatorial loop and shown a curved trajectory.

The spectral dependence of the covariances between residual maps is, for the Sroll2 version of the data, compatible with a dust model assuming only temperature variations rather than spectral index variations, while it is incompatible with either of them for the PR4 Planck official release. Our methodology can be used to analyze future high precision polarization data and build more accurate dust models to be used by the CMB community."}

X-ray flares, observed during the afterglow phase, are generally believed to originate from the prolonged activity of the central engine, though direct evidence has been scarce. In this study, we present a comprehensive statistical analysis of X-ray flares from 315 GRBs observed by the Swift/X-ray Telescope over nearly two decades. We categorize flares into prompt flares (occurring during the prompt emission phase) and afterglow flares and compare their temporal and luminosity properties. Our analysis reveals that both types of flares exhibit similar morphological characteristics, with prompt flares being brighter and occurring earlier than afterglow flares. We find strong correlations between flare parameters, such as peak time, duration, and luminosity, which follow consistent patterns across both flare types. These findings suggest that X-ray flares, regardless of their timing, share a common origin in the central engine's activity. Our results imply that the central engine's activity duration extends beyond the prompt gamma-ray emission phase, highlighting the importance of considering X-ray flares when studying GRB progenitors and central engine properties. This work provides robust statistical evidence supporting the central engine origin of X-ray flares and underscores the need for future observations with missions like the Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor and Einstein Probe to further elucidate the nature of GRB central engines."}

Our work is valid for the Hunt & Reffert catalogue of clusters in Gaia DR3. We developed and open-sourced our cluster simulator from our first work. Then, we performed 80,590 injection and retrievals of simulated open clusters to test the Hunt & Reffert catalogue's sensitivity. We fit a logistic model of cluster detectability that depends only on a cluster's number of stars, median parallax error, Gaia data density, and a user-specified significance threshold. We find that our simple model accurately predicts cluster detectability, with a 94.53\\% accuracy on our training data that is comparable to a machine-learning based model with orders of magnitude more parameters. Our model itself offers numerous insights on why certain clusters are detected. We briefly use our model to show that cluster detectability depends on non-intuitive parameters, such as a cluster's proper motion, and we show that even a modest 25 km/s boost to a cluster's orbital speed can result in an almost 3$\\times$ higher detection probability, depending on its position. In addition, we publish our raw cluster injection and retrievals and cluster memberships, which could be used for a number of other science cases -- such as estimating cluster membership incompleteness.

This paper aims to investigate the acceleration during planetary migration in detail using numerical simulations, delving deeper into the early solar system's preserved information. We confirm that planetary migration is a positive feedback process: the faster the migration, the more efficient the consumption of planetesimals; once the migration slows down, Neptune clears the surrounding space, making further migration more difficult to sustain. Quantitatively, a tenfold increase in migration rate corresponds to an approximately 30% reduction in the mass of planetesimals consumed to increase per unit angular momentum of Neptune. We also find that Neptune's final position is correlated with the initial surface density of planetesimals at that location, suggesting that the disk density at 30au was approximately 0.009$M_{\\oplus}/au^2$ in the early solar system. Two mechanisms that can accelerate planetary migration are identified: the first is MMR between Uranus and Neptune. Migration acceleration will be triggered whenever these two giant planets cross their major MMR. The second mechanism is the ring structure within the planetesimal disk, as the higher planetesimal density in this region can provide the material support necessary for migration acceleration. Our research indicates that Neptune in the current solar system occupies a relatively delicate position. In case Neptune crossed the 1:2 MMR with Uranus, it could have migrated to a much more distant location. Therefore, under the influence of the positive feedback mechanism, the evolution of the solar system to its current configuration might be a stochastic outcome rather than an inevitable consequence."}

Approximately $17\\%$ of the double-peaked LAEs are blue-dominated, suggesting gas inflows. The blue-to-total flux ratio exhibits a luminosity dependence: fainter lines generally show higher blue flux, though some luminous sources also show strong blue peaks. We find a narrowing of the red peak at $z > 4$, despite the presence of the blue peak, indicating intrinsic galaxy evolution rather than IGM attenuation. Several LAEs exhibit residual flux in the absorption trough, with normalised trough flux anticorrelating with peak separation, reflecting variations in HI column density. We further investigate spatially resolved properties of ten red-dominated LAEs with extended Ly$\\alpha$ halos. Despite azimuthal variations, both the blue-to-total flux ratio and normalised trough flux density increase with radius, while peak separation decreases. The red peak asymmetry shows only minor radial changes. These trends are consistent with variations in shell outflow velocity and HI column density across the halos.

This is the first case of falling CO clouds having direct observed signatures of the falling motion including clear directivity and shock heating.

A remarkable member of this stellar class, HE 0107-5240 with [Fe/H]=-5.56, has been identified as part of a binary system. To constrain its orbital parameters, radial velocity monitoring has been carried out using the ESPRESSO spectrograph. Radial velocities were derived using cross-correlation with a template, taking advantage of the strong G-band feature. Combining all observations yielded a high signal-to-noise spectrum, which has been used to refine our understanding of the stellar chemical composition. Additionally, a co-added UVES spectrum in the blue was used to complement the wavelength coverage of ESPRESSO. Observations of HE 0107-5240 over a span of more than four years have yielded a revised orbital period of about 29 years. Updated elemental abundances have been determined for Sc, Cr, Co, and, tentatively, Al, along with a new upper limit for Be. The iron abundance has been derived from ionised Fe lines. Significant upper limits have been established for Li, Si, and Sr. The star is confirmed to be a long-period binary. Iron abundances derived from neutral and ionised lines are consistent with local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE) assumption, casting doubt on published deviation from LTE corrections for Fe for this star. The heavy elements Sr and Ba remain undetected, confirming the classification of HE 0107-5240 as a carbon enhanced metal-poor and non enhanced in heavy elements (CEMP-no) star and supporting the absence of an n-capture element plateau at the lowest metallicities."}

Classic pebble drift models treat volatile species individually as sublimating at their respective snowlines, although observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) suggest that ices are likely mixed; laboratory studies suggest ice mixtures can exhibit more complex sublimation behaviours, remaining trapped beyond their nominal sublimation temperatures. We present the first model that couples pebble growth and drift with CO entrapment inside water ice - preventing a fraction (up to ~60%) of the CO from sublimating at its snowline, instead desorbing via volcanic desorption at the water crystallisation front, at 130K. Our models show that CO entrapment will significantly impact the carbon and oxygen distributions, enhancing the gas-phase C/O and C/H inside the water snowline by up to a factor of 10 over 1 Myr and a factor of a few around the CO2 snowline; O/H is also increased around the CO2 snowline, but is water-dominated in the inner disc. Entrapment therefore provides a means of introducing more carbon to the inner disc whilst retaining a large amount of water. We discuss connections to planet formation, noting that CO entrapment can increase the gas-phase heavy element content around the water snowline by up to 150%. We also consider links to JWST observations and highlight the importance of entrapment for pebble drift models to accurately model disc composition."}

This enables investigations of the diurnal variation of the current climate on Mars on a planetary scale without significant local time (LT) gaps or confusions from correlated seasonal variations. Here, we present the results of diurnal temperature variations and thermal tides in the Martian atmosphere using temperature profiles retrieved from the Emirates Mars InfraRed Spectrometer (EMIRS) observations. The data during the primary mission is included, covering an entire Martian Year (MY) starting from MY 36 LS = 49\u00b0. The diurnal temperature patterns suggest a dominant diurnal tide in most seasons, while the semi-diurnal tide presents a similar amplitude near perihelion. The seasonal variation of the diurnal tide latitudinal distribution is well explained by the total vorticity due to zonal wind, while that of the semi-diurnal tide following both dust and water ice clouds, and the ter-diurnal tide following the dust only.

In this study our motivations are both scientific and technical. Our technical goal is to establish a multimodel sparse sampled ensemble approach for coherently exploring large unconstrained parameter spaces typical in exoplanet science. Our science goal is to determine relationships that connect observations to the underlying climate across a large parameter space of atmospheric compositions for TRAPPIST-1 e. We consider atmospheric compositions of N2, CO2, CH4, and H2O, with water clouds and photochemical hazes. We use a 1D photochemical model, a 3D climate model, and a transmission spectral model, filtered through a quasi-Monte Carlo sparse sampling approach applied across atmospheric compositions. While clouds and hazes have significant effects on the transmission spectra, CO2 and CH4 can be potentially detected in <10 transits for certain compositional and climate states. Colder climates have better prospects for characterization, due to being relatively dry and having fewer clouds, permitting transmission observations to probe more deeply into their atmospheres. CH4 volume mixing ratios of >$10^{-3}$ trigger strong antigreenhouse cooling, where near-IR absorption simultaneously creates an inversion in the stratosphere and reduces the stellar radiation reaching the planet surface. In such cases, interpreting the disk-averaged emission and albedo at face value can yield misleading conclusions, as here low albedo and high thermal emission are associated with cold planets. Future work will use our sparse sampling approach to explore broader parameter spaces and other observationally amenable exoplanets."}

In the present study, we investigated the possible existence of a universal relation between the binding energy of compact stars and the frequency of their non-radial oscillations. The main motivation was related to the fact that both of the aforementioned quantities might be measured in the occurrence of a supernova explosion. Interestingly, we found that there is a empirical relation between the oscillation frequency and the binding energy for both $f$ and $p_1$ modes, assuming hadronic stellar matter. The inclusion of hybrid equations of state, incorporating sharp phase transitions, was shown to result into deviations from the aforementioned quasi-universal relation."}

While this is a substantial number, it represents only a small fraction of the total neutron star mergers expected to be observed by third-generation networks. These projections rely on several simplifying assumptions-including the adopted merger rate, the kilonova luminosity distribution, and the configuration and scheduling of future surveys-which introduce notable uncertainties.

Turbulence in post-flare loops, particularly from Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHI), has been suggested and investigated as a mechanism for trapping and accelerating electrons in such scenarios. Starting from past results, we aim to characterize the energization process of electrons trapped in a turbulent post-flare looptop, quantifying the contributions of different acceleration mechanisms, and establishing a coherent numerical framework for describing particle energetics. We perform test-particle simulations with the guiding-centre approximation on top of a 2.5D magnetohydrodynamic model of a time-evolving post-flare coronal looptop. We implement an improved formulation of the guiding-centre equations that explicitly conserves energy, enabling a consistent analysis of electron acceleration in the turbulent plasma. We find that, in the plasma turbulence inside the looptop, electrons develop suprathermal energy distributions with tails compatible with hard X-ray emission. The dominant energization channel arises from perpendicular gradient effects in the form of second-order Fermi-like stochastic acceleration, while curvature effects are dominant for particles on long trajectories. Statistical correlations with the measured particle pitch angle confirm that the strongest acceleration occurs for electrons trapped in bouncing motions within turbulent magnetic structures. Our results provide an understanding of how KHI-induced turbulence in coronal looptops produces and sustains populations of trapped nonthermal electrons.

We study the possibility for DSA to energize particles from the thermal pool and from pre-existing cosmic rays at radiative shocks, focusing on the case of supernova remnants (SNRs). We rely on a semi-analytical description of particle acceleration at collisionless shocks in the test-particle limit, estimating the total proton and electron content from SNRs throughout the radiative phase. Our results indicate that DSA can lead to significant particle acceleration during the first few tens of kyrs of the radiative phase. Although the associated multi-wavelength emission from SNRs in the radiative phase may not be detectable with current observatories in most cases, the radiative phase is found to lead to substantial deviations from the canonical p$^{-4}$ of the test-particle limit. The hardening/steepening is due to an interplay between a growing contribution of the reaccelerated term as the SNR volume expands and the effects of adiabatic and radiative losses on trapped particles as particles are confined for a longer time. The slope of the cumulative proton and electron spectra over the SNR lifetime thus depends on the environment in which the SNR shock propagates, and on the duration of the radiative phase during which DSA can take place. Overall, DSA in the radiative phase can lead to a total electron spectrum steeper than the proton spectrum, both at SNRs from thermonuclear and core-collapse SNe. Finally, we comment on the case of young radiative SNRs (in the first month to a few years after the explosion) for which the denser environments (with mass-loss rates of $\\dot{M} \\sim 10^{-1} - 1$ M$_{\\odot}$/yr) tend to inhibit DSA."}

Fixed aperture photometry of the comet is well described by a power law function of heliocentric distance, rH, with the exponent (``index\") n = 3.8+/-0.3 across the 4.6 au to 1.8 au distance range (phase function 0.04+/-0.02 magnitude/degree assumed). This indicates that the dust production rates vary in proportion to rH**(-1.8+/-0.3). An rH**(-2) variation is expected of a strongly volatile material, and consistent with independent spectroscopic observations showing that carbon dioxide is the primary driver of activity. The measured heliocentric index is unremarkable in the context of solar system comets, for which n is widely dispersed, and provides no basis on which to describe 3I as either dynamically old (thermally processed) or new (pristine). The morphology of the comet changes from a Sun-facing dust fan in the early 2025 July observations, to one dominated by an antisolar dust tail at later dates. We attribute the delayed emergence of the tail to the large size (effective radius 0.1 mm) and slow ejection (5 m/s) of the optically dominant dust particles, and their consequently sluggish response to solar radiation pressure. Small (micron-sized) particles may be present but not in numbers sufficient to dominate the scattering cross-section. Their relative depletion possibly reflects interparticle cohesion, which binds small particles more effectively than large ones. A similar preponderance of 0.1 mm grains was reported in 2I/Borisov. However, 2I differed from 3I in having a much smaller (asteroid-like) heliocentric index, n = 1.9+/-0.1. Dust production rates in 3I are 180 kg/s at 2 au, compared with 70 kg/s in 2I/Borisov at the same distance."}

Studies have attributed these CCSN remnants to the jittering-jet explosion mechanism (JJEM), which involves two or three energetic pairs of jets participating in the explosion. We, therefore, conclude that the structure of the photospheric shells of SN 2023ixf supports its explosion by the JJEM.

This tension becomes progressively pronounced for more massive PBHs, posing substantial challenges for USR models to yield a detectable PBH abundance, especially in the mass range probed by ongoing and future gravitational-wave experiments such as LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) and the Einstein Telescope (ET). However, this discrepancy is minimal for asteroid-mass PBHs, which are still capable of feasibly constituting the entirety of dark matter (DM). To numerically probe the six-dimensional parameter space of polynomial models, we adapted a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to efficiently scan over the space of viable models. Our results further indicate that, in non-minimally coupled polynomial inflation, a viable cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum is best obtained at an inflection point for which second-order slow-roll approximation is necessary for precise CMB predictions."}

While their impact has been well-studied on linear scales, this work develops the framework for and presents results from the first set of cosmological N-body simulations that can track the effects of LiMRs, as a function of their mass and temperature, down to fully nonlinear scales. Importantly, our simulations model the impact of both the massive Standard Model neutrinos and LiMRs, which will be crucial in disentangling possible degeneracies. We systematically explore the effects of LiMR properties such as mass, temperature, and initial distribution, on various cosmological observables, including the total matter power spectrum, Halo Mass Functions (HMF), Mass-Concentration relation, radial halo profiles, and weak lensing signals around massive clusters. The framework and simulations developed here will enable detailed follow-up of the rich phenomenology of LiMR cosmologies."}

Here we focus on double degenerate systems, where two WDs are interacting, and on the double detonation mechanism, where a detonation of a helium shell triggers a detonation of the carbon-oxygen core of the primary WD. We take the results from three-dimensional SN simulations of Pakmor et al 2022 (arXiv:2203.14990) and carry them into the supernova remnant (SNR) phase, until 1500 yr after the explosion. We reveal signatures of the SN imprinted in the SNR morphology. We confirm the impact of a companion on the SNR: its presence induces a conical shadow in the ejecta, that is long lived. Its intersection with the shocked shell is visible in projection as a ring, an ellipse, or a bar, depending on the orientation. New, we test the case of a nested explosion model, in which the explosion of the primary induces the secondary to also explode. As the explosion of the secondary WD is weaker only the primary outer ejecta interact with the ambient medium and form the main SNR shell. The secondary inner ejecta collide with the reverse shock, which enhances the density and thus the X-ray emissivity. The composition at the points of impact is peculiar, since what is revealed are the outer layers from the inner ejecta. This effect can be probed with spatially-resolved X-ray spectroscopy of young SNRs."}

However, uncertainties and degeneracies-where different parameter sets produce similar light curves-make this task challenging. We propose a deep learning framework for inferring pulsar parameters from observed light curves. Traditional deep learning models are not designed to produce multiple degenerate solutions for a given input. To address this, we introduce a custom loss function that incorporates a light curve emulator as a forward model, along with a dissimilarity loss that encourages the model to capture diverse, degenerate parameter sets for a given light curve. We further introduce a test-time optimization scheme that refines predicted parameters by minimizing the discrepancy between the observed light curve and those reconstructed by the forward model from predicted parameters during inference. The model is trained using a suite of state-of-the-art simulated pulsar light curves. Finally, we demonstrate that the parameter sets predicted by our approach reproduce light curves that are consistent with the true observation."}

We search for evidence of an H$\\alpha$ transit in high-resolution spectra of three young planets, HD 63433b (400 Myr), DS TucAb (45 Myr), and HIP 67522b (17 Myr) using HARPS-N, Magellan-PFS, and CHIRON respectively.

We find no evidence of a transit signal for HD 63433b and DS Tuc A b (3$\\sigma$ limits of 0.9% and 0.3%, respectively). For HIP 67522b, we detect significant excess absorption (3.44$\\pm$0.28%) aligned with the transit time, narrow compared to the stellar line, and blueshifted from the stellar rest frame. In combination, these suggest the signal is from the planet. However, stellar variation in the H$\\alpha$ line over the course of the observations is comparable in size to the transit signature and the duration is shorter than the photometric transit, so this detection requires confirmation. Our findings, and other recent results in the literature, suggest that planets younger than 50 Myr are more favorable for the detection of atmospheric escape with H$\\alpha$ observations, though older populations might still show escape in other diagnostics."}

We simultaneously characterize the transition in the distribution of BBH mass-ratios, effective aligned and effective precessing spins using our flexible models.

However, the presence of Galactic foregrounds poses significant challenges, possibly biasing the $r$ estimate. In this study we explore the viability of using Minkowski functionals (MFs) as a robustness test to validate a potential $r$ detection by identifying non-Gaussian features associated with foregrounds contamination. To do so, we simulate sky maps as observed by a LiteBIRD-like CMB experiment, with realistic instrumental and foregrounds modelling. The CMB $B$-mode signal is recovered through blind component separation algorithms, and the obtained (biased) value of $r$ is used to generate Gaussian realisation of CMB signal. Their MFs are then compared with those computed on maps contaminated by foreground residual left by component separation, looking for a detection of non-Gaussianity. Our results demonstrate that, with the experimental configuration considered here, MFs can not be reliably adopted as a robustness test of an eventual $r$ detection, as we find that in the majority of the cases MFs are not able to raise significant warnings about the non-Gaussianity induced by the presence of foreground residuals. In the most realistic and refined scenario we adopted, the test is able to flag non-Gaussianity in $\\sim 26\\%$ of the simulations, meaning that there is no warning on the biased tensor-to-scalar ratio in $\\sim 74\\%$ of cases. These results suggest that more advanced statistics than MFs must be considered to look for non-Gaussian signatures of foregrounds, in order to be able to perform reliable null tests in future CMB missions."}
